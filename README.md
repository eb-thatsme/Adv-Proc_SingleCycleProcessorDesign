# Adv-Proc_SingleCycleProcessorDesign
This Verilog project implements a single-cycle processor design based on the block diagram seen in 'blockDiagram.jpg'. The processor is able to execute load, store, ore, R-type (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, SLT, AND, OR), branch, and jump instructions. A sample of the ALU module is shown in the main branch of this repo, named  'ALU.v'. All project modules can be downloaded from the zip. This code also includes testbenches which were designed to test functionality for each module in the processor. For a full report on the funtionality of each module in the processor, please see 'Advanced_Processors_Final_Paper.docx'. This project was a collborative effort between myself and 3 classmates.
