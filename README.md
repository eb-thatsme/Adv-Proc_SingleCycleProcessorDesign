# Adv-Proc_SingleCycleProcessorDesign
This Verilog project implements a single-cycle processor design based on the block diagram seen in 'blockDiagram.jpg'. The processor is able to execute load, store, ore, R-type (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, SLT, AND, OR), branch, and jump instructions. This code also includes testbenches which were designed to test functionality for each module in the processor. For a full report on the funtionality of each module in the processor, please see 'Advanced_Processors_Final_Paper.docx'. This project was a collborative effort between myself and 3 classmates.
